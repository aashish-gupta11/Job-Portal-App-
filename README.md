Developed a full-stack job portal using the MERN stack, enabling users to
 register and log in as either students or recruiters. The portal alows students to
 browse job listings, apply for positions, and manage their applications.
 Recruiters, on the other hand, can create company profiles, post job
 vacancies, and review applications submitted by students. Based on the
 applicants' qualifications, recruiters can accept or reject applications. The
 platform uses MongoDB for database management, Express.js and Node.js
 for the backend, and React.js for the front-end, with authentication and
 authorization features to ensure secure access for both students and
 recruiters.
